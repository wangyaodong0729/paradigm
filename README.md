# paradigm

The hierarchical paradigm comprises four conditions of increasing complexity:


\textbf{Rest ($c_0$):} Participants maintaines visual fixation on a centrally displayed stationary cross for 180 seconds with eyes open to establish baseline neural activity.

\textbf{R1 ($c_1$):} In this Gross Motor Control Task, participants observe visual stimuli showing either a left or right hand being raised and imitated the action by raising their corresponding physical hand. Each 5-second trial consists of a 1-second rest period, 1-second stimulus presentation, 2-second response window, and 1-second post-response rest. Thirty trials per direction are collected (60 total).


\textbf{R2 ($c_2$):} The Fine Motor Control Task requires participants to press left or right arrow keys in response to directional cues on screen, translating visual information into discrete fine motor responses. This maintains the same trial structure as R1 (5 seconds/trial, 30 trials per direction).



\textbf{R3 ($c_3$):} The Cognitive-Motor Integration Task presents targets at four different screen locations (up, down, left, right) that spatially mapped to corresponding arrow keys. Participants presses the appropriate key as quickly and accurately as possible, requiring sustained attention, rapid visual processing, and multi-directional motor control. Using the same trial structure, 30 trials are collected for each of the four directions.
